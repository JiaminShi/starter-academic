I am a senior year undergraduate at University of Waterloo, majoring  in Computer Science. Beside computer science, I have taken some fine arts and pure/applied mathemetics electives. Currently, I am working with Prof. Christopher Batty on physically-based rendering with focus on fluid simulation.

I also did a few software engineer internships at different companies.

You can look at my [old website](https://jiaminshi.github.io/) for some art projects.
